#### Recomended by R1 to learn directories layout:

Basically how I must organize my directories.
 - `cmd`/ : The main code
 - `internal`/ : Privates "libraries"
 - `pkg`/ : That can be shared for external projects.
 - `vendor`/ : dependencies.
All with examples and much more referencies to study. Good place to look about new topics.
