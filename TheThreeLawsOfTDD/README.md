# The Three Laws of TDD by Uncle Bob

https://youtu.be/qkblc5WRn-U

## 1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a gailing unit test pass

## 2. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures

## 3. You are not allowed to write any more production code tha is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test

Cycle: wirte test and fail > make the code pass > refact

The tests works like a documentation to understand how the code runs.
Make the perfect way to developers understand: reading CODE!

Write tests isn't fun, unless it is write beffore the source code!

- Test first it's fun.
- It's make feel the power.
- It's make impossible to make a func that is'nt possible to test.
- Func easy to test make make easy to couple.
- Makes a security test swit.
